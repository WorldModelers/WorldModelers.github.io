The World Modelers program aims to develop an integrated system of human-machine collaborative technologies, to address questions about national and global security. The system is intended to help analysts save time and resources traditionally spent on painstaking and slow manual processing, by quickly and semi-automatically integrating and synthesizing information at scale from a variety of sources, including published literature, expert domain models, and structured data sources. This knowledge is used to build qualitative and quantitative computational pipelines to understand causal relations and make forecasts, in order to support decision-making processes in complex scenarios.

The content is divided into three toolkits encompassing the main three functional areas in the program:
- Corpus Ingestion and Assembly
- Qualitative Analysis
- Quantitative Analysis
