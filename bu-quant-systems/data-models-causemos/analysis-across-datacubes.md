# Analysis Across Datacubes

Causemos supports several types of quantitative analyses across
datacubes, including:

-   **Overlay - Correlation Among Variables**: Determine whether an
    increase in *x* usually led to an increase or a decrease in *y*
    historically. When indicator *x* was particularly high/low
    historically, find the values of other indicators of interest
    (drivers/impacts).
    ![Overlay timeseries for drought, water stress, displacement and food price indicators. Historically, drought and water stress are correlated (red arrows). In Jan 2020 (blue vertical line), they also pushed commodity prices to a new peak, which was followed by the highest level of displacement.](../../images/causemos/image48.jpg)
-   **Overlay - Similar Models/Data Comparison**: Determine the
    similarity of the output of alternative models for comparable
    scenarios. Determine how similar the data is from different
    sources for a particular variable.

-   **Region Ranking**: Find which regions are currently best/worst with
    respect to variable(s) of interest.
    ![Rank regions based on current needs assessment, considering poverty, malnutrition, likelihood of locust presence and water stress.](../../images/causemos/image49.jpg)
