## Project Overview

CauseMos is a tool for model assembly. This includes the ability to search for models, seed them with data, execute models, test them, and to build a set of candidate models. The end-user for CauseMos is a modeler--someone with sufficient technical expertise to assemble models. 

CauseMos allows for the manipulation and execution of “top-down” models. These are models that typically originate via machine reading of relevant documents. The machine reading produces causal statements which are assembled through INDRA. INDRA output’s an assembled model in Causal Analysis Graph (CAG) form. Through CauseMos, the modeler can manipulate the CAG by curating its nodes and adjusting its edges. The modeler can also execute the CAG.

CauseMos also allows the modeler to interact with “bottom-up” models. These are lower-level physical, socio-economic, or political models which are typically generated and maintained by academic institutions. These models can be theoretical in nature or may rely on machine learning. CauseMos allows the modeler to search for relevant bottom-up models, tune their parameters, and to execute them.

## World Modelers Integration

CauseMos obtains assembled models from [INDRA](http://indra.readthedocs.io/) in the form of a `Causal Analysis Graph` (CAG). The modeler can manipulate
