## Project Overview

CauseWorks is a planning tool whose end-user is a planner or analyst. The focus of CauseWorks is to allow the planner to simulate scenarios and determine appropriate interventions (policy, aid, military, etc.). 

CauseWorks relies on pre-assembled models produced from CauseMos. These pre-assembled models can be perturbed by the planner with various interventions in CauseWorks. Primarily, planners in CauseWorks will be interacting with top-down models produced by modelers from CauseMos, though these models may have been seeded or adjusted based on the forecasts the modeler derived from bottom-up models.
