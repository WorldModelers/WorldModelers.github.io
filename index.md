# World Modelers

The World Modelers program aims to develop technology that integrates qualitative causal analyses with quantitative models and relevant data to provide a comprehensive understanding of complicated, dynamic national security questions. The goal is to develop approaches that can accommodate and integrate dozens of contributing models connected by thousands of pathwaysâ€”orders of magnitude beyond what is possible today.

World Modelers analyses are intended to be timely enough to recommend specific actions that could avert crises. The program seeks to develop technologies that will provide clearly parameterized, quantitative projections within weeks or even hours of processing, compared to the months or years it takes today to understand considerably simpler systems.

World Modelers technologies will be applied to increasingly varied use cases as they mature through the phases of the program. Questions for analysis will typically be framed at subnational scales and look one to five years into the future, although the factors that influence outcomes of interest might operate on larger spatial and temporal scales. This subnational focus reflects the changing nature of conflict and security, which, increasingly, plays out in cities and districts. The first use case of World Modelers is food insecurity resulting from the interactions of multiple factors, including climate, water availability, soil viability, market instability, and physical security.

## Top Down vs. Bottom Up Modeling

World Modelers aims to combine two types of modeling approaches:

* A "top-down" approach which begins with expert knowledge
* A "bottom-up" approach which begins with physical or quantitative models.

In the top-down approach, modelers curate a set of documents that contain expert knowledge about complex systems. Machine reading software scans these documents to extract _causal statements_. These _causal statements_ are assembled into a _causal analysis graph_ or CAG. The modeler can then manipulate and execute the CAG. 

In the bottom-up approach, modelers select relevant quantitative models and tune them based on the scenario being modeled. The modeler can then execute these models, the output of which may feed into the modelers' understanding of the scenario described in a CAG.

## Modeling Systems
The World Modelers Pipeline is comprised of four primary types of systems:

* Machine reading systems
* Modeling systems
* Sensitivity analysis systems
* Human machine interfaces
