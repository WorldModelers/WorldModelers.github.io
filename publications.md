### Kimetrica

* CHIRTS -- We are close to re-submitting a paper on CHIRTS-daily to Scientific Data.
We have revised CHIRTS-daily to use a different satellite input (ERA5 instead of
MERRA2), have increased the accuracy of the previous product (based on validation
from station data and external products). All of these results will be summarized in the paper. A new Usage Section focuses on a sample application in Ethiopia.
