# DART

The Data Analytics and Reasoning Toolkit (DART) is the data ingestion pipeline for the World Modelers platform. 
Its primary function is to extract metadata and text from source documents, convert these data to a normalized 
data format, and pass this normalized data on to the reader technologies that can identify and extract causal 
relations for use in Causemos. It provides APIs and user interfaces for document submission, retrieval, and 
search, and it handles storage and retrieval of reader outputs. Finally, it provides APIs and user-facing tools 
for managing and developing the ontologies used by the readers to ground causal extractions.
