## Disclaimer

Development of the `SOFIA` Reader ended before a few key features were introduced to the World Modelers Machine Reading Pipeline. As a result, there are a number of caveats that must be taken into account in order to use `SOFIA` to produce Reader Outputs.

1. **Ontology structure**

    `SOFIA` works with an older version of the World Modelers Ontology structure. The latest version of the ontologies used by the other Readers uses an updated format that is not natively recognized `SOFIA`. There is a CLI tool for translating the ontology into something `SOFIA` can use that is provided with the [DART Concepts Explorer](https://github.com/twosixlabs-dart/dart-ui) project. Any ontologies developed with the *Ontology in a Day (OIAD)* workflow must be run through this utility first before `SOFIA` can use it. Instructions for running this utility can be found [here](https://github.com/twosixlabs-dart/dart-ui#translate-backwards).

2. **No support for dynamic ontology loading**

    `SOFIA` can only support a single ontology per instance of the application. It loads a static resource from the filesystem on startup and has not been integrated with the [Ontology Registry](https://github.com/twosixlabs-dart/ontology-registry). Furthermore, due to the necessity to adapt the ontology structure out-of-band, it is not currently possible to support the dynamic "hot swapping" of ontologies at runtime. Therefore, to utilize `SOFIA` to obtain Reader Outputs for the latest version of the *World Modelers Machine Reading Pipeline*, one of the following deployment scenarios must be chosen.
    
    a. Run multiple instances of the `SOFIA` application with different ontologies
        `SOFIA` can be run as a realtime stream processor if the ontologies are stable and provided ahead of time. Provided that the ontology has been properly translated, you can run a single instance of the `SOFIA` application for each ontology. The file is specified with the `ONTOLOGY` environment variable when starting the Docker container.


    b. Process the data "offline" in batches
        The `SOFIA` Reader can also be run as an offline batch process. This scenario is also contingent on a set of stable ontologies being available ahead of time. To support this scenario, one can run `SOFIA` with the `KAFKA_AUTO_OFFSERT_RESET` parameter set to `earliest` to force it to process the entire CDR update stream each time. `SOFIA` can be run once per ontology to produce the desired Reader Outputs.

At the time of writing, the changes necessary to run `SOFIA` with the latest World Modelers configuration has not been merged into the `master` branch. One must use a Docker image that is based off of [this fork](https://github.com/twosixlabs-dart/WM-src) or [this branch](TODO) of the main repository. The following Docker compose configuration can be used to run `SOFIA` in order to support both of the scenarios outlined above:
